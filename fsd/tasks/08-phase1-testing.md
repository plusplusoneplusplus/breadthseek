# Task 8: Phase 1 Testing Suite

**ID:** `fsd-phase1-testing`
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Duration:** 3 hours
**Status:** Completed

## Description

Create comprehensive test coverage for all Phase 1 components to ensure reliability.

Implement test suites for:

### Unit Tests
- **Task schema** validation and parsing
- **State machine** transitions and persistence
- **Checkpoint system** creation, rollback, and resume
- **Configuration system** loading and merging
- **Activity tracking** logging and querying
- **CLI commands** argument parsing and help text

### Integration Tests
- **End-to-end task submission** flow
- **State machine + checkpoint** integration
- **Config loading** from multiple sources
- **Activity logging** across components
- **CLI → Core** interaction

### Test Infrastructure
- Set up pytest fixtures for common test scenarios
- Create mock helpers for Git operations
- Build test utilities for creating sample tasks
- Implement test project scaffolding
- Add test data fixtures

Testing goals:
- **Code coverage:** ≥80% for all Phase 1 components
- **Fast execution:** Full test suite runs in < 30 seconds
- **Isolated tests:** No test dependencies, can run in any order
- **Clear failures:** Descriptive error messages when tests fail

## Context

- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Use pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Mock external dependencies (Git, file system when appropriate)
- Create reusable fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`
- Use temporary directories for integration tests
- Consider using pytest-xdist for parallel test execution

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Test coverage ≥80% for all Phase 1 modules
- ✅ All unit tests pass consistently
- ✅ Integration tests validate component interactions
- ✅ Tests are well-organized and documented
- ✅ Test suite runs quickly (< 30s)
- ✅ CI/CD integration ready (can run in GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Test fixtures and utilities are reusable
- ✅ Mock helpers simplify testing
