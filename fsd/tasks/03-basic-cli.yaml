# Task 3: Basic CLI Interface
id: fsd-basic-cli
description: |
  Create the basic command-line interface for FSD using Click.
  
  Implement these core commands:
  - `fsd init` - Initialize FSD in the current project (create .fsd/ directory, config)
  - `fsd submit <task-file>` - Submit a task from a YAML file
  - `fsd submit --interactive` - Interactive task creation wizard
  - `fsd queue list` - List all queued/running/completed tasks
  - `fsd status` - Show current execution status
  - `fsd logs <task-id>` - View logs for a specific task
  
  The CLI should:
  - Use Click for command structure and argument parsing
  - Have proper help text and examples for each command
  - Support --verbose flag for detailed output
  - Use rich/colorama for nice terminal output with colors
  - Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
  
  For now, just implement the command structure and basic functionality.
  Don't worry about the actual task execution yet - that comes later.
