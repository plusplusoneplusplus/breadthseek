# Task 1: Project Setup and Structure
id: fsd-project-setup
description: |
  Set up the basic FSD project structure and development environment.
  
  Create the core directory structure for the FSD system:
  - fsd/ (main package directory)
  - fsd/cli/ (command-line interface)
  - fsd/core/ (core orchestration logic)
  - fsd/agents/ (Claude CLI agent wrapper)
  - fsd/tracking/ (activity tracking system)
  - fsd/config/ (configuration management)
  - tests/ (test suite)
  
  Set up the Python package with:
  - pyproject.toml with dependencies (click for CLI, pydantic for config, etc.)
  - Basic __init__.py files
  - Development dependencies (pytest, ruff, mypy)
  - Pre-commit hooks for code quality
  
  Make sure to use uv for package management as per project standards.
